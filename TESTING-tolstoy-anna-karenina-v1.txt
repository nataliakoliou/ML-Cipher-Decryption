i am not jealous but i am unsatisfied but she opened her lips and shifted her place in the carriage in the excitement aroused by the thought that suddenly struck her if i could be anything but a mistress passionately caring for nothing but his caresses but i cannot and i do not care to be anything else and by that desire i rouse aversion in him and he rouses fury in me and it cannot be different do not i know that he would not deceive me that he has no schemes about princess sorokina that hes not in love with kitty that he will not desert me i know all that but it makes it no better for me if without loving me from duty he will be good and kind to me without what i want thats a thousand times worse than unkindness thats hell and thats just how it is for a long while now he has not loved me and where love ends hate begins i do not know these streets at all hills it seems and still houses and houses and in the houses always people and people how many of them no end and all hating each other come let me try and think what i want to make me happy well suppose i am divorced and alexey alexandrovitch lets me have seryozha and i marry vronsky thinking of alexey alexandrovitch she at once pictured him with extraordinary vividness as though he were alive before her with his mild lifeless dull eyes the blue veins in his white hands his intonations and the cracking of his fingers and remembering the feeling which had existed between them and which was also called love she shuddered with loathing well i am divorced and become vronskys wife well will kitty cease looking at me as she looked at me today no and will seryozha leave off asking and wondering about my two husbands and is there any new feeling i can awaken between vronsky and me is there possible if not happiness some sort of ease from misery no no she answered now without the slightest hesitation impossible we are drawn apart by life and i make his unhappiness and he mine and theres no altering him or me every attempt has been made the screw has come unscrewed oh a beggar woman with a baby she thinks i am sorry for her are not we all flung into the world only to hate each other and so to torture ourselves and each other schoolboys coming laughing seryozha she thought i thought too that i loved him and used to be touched by my own tenderness but i have lived without him i gave him up for another love and did not regret the exchange till that love was satisfied and with loathing she thought of what she meant by that love and the clearness with which she saw life now her own and all mens was a pleasure to her it is so with me and pyotr and the coachman fyodor and that merchant and all the people living along the volga where those placards invite one to go and everywhere and always she thought when she had driven under the low pitched roof of the nizhigorod station and the porters ran to meet her a ticket to obiralovka said pyotr she had utterly forgotten where and why she was going and only by a great effort she understood the question yes she said handing him her purse and taking a little red bag in her hand she got out of the carriage making her way through the crowd to the first class waiting room she gradually recollected all the details of her position and the plans between which she was hesitating and again at the old sore places hope and then despair poisoned the wounds of her tortured fearfully throbbing heart as she sat on the star shaped sofa waiting for the train she gazed with aversion at the people coming and going they were all hateful to her and thought how she would arrive at the station would write him a note and what she would write to him and how he was at this moment complaining to his mother of his position not understanding her sufferings and how she would go into the room and what she would say to him then she thought that life might still be happy and how miserably she loved and hated him and how fearfully her heart was beating chapter a bell rang some young men ugly and impudent and at the same time careful of the impression they were making hurried by pyotr too crossed the room in his livery and top boots with his dull animal face and came up to her to take her to the train some noisy men were quiet as she passed them on the platform and one whispered something about her to another something vile no doubt she stepped up on the high step and sat down in a carriage by herself on a dirty seat that had been white her bag lay beside her shaken up and down by the springiness of the seat with a foolish smile pyotr raised his hat with its colored band at the window in token of farewell an impudent conductor slammed the door and the latch a grotesque looking lady wearing a bustle anna mentally undressed the woman and was appalled at her hideousness and a little girl laughing affectedly ran down the platform katerina andreevna shes got them all ma tante cried the girl even the childs hideous and affected thought anna to avoid seeing anyone she got up quickly and seated herself at the opposite window of the empty carriage a misshapen looking peasant covered with dirt in a cap from which his tangled hair stuck out all round passed by that window stooping down to the carriage wheels theres something familiar about that hideous peasant thought anna and remembering her dream she moved away to the opposite door shaking with terror the conductor opened the door and let in a man and his wife do you wish to get out anna made no answer the conductor and her two fellow passengers did not notice under her veil her panic stricken face she went back to her corner and sat down the couple seated themselves on the opposite side and intently but surreptitiously scrutinized her clothes both husband and wife seemed repulsive to anna the husband asked would she allow him to smoke obviously not with a view to smoking but to getting into conversation with her receiving her assent he said to his wife in french something about caring less to smoke than to talk they made inane and affected remarks to one another entirely for her benefit anna saw clearly that they were sick of each other and hated each other and no one could have helped hating such miserable monstrosities a second bell sounded and was followed by moving of luggage noise shouting and laughter it was so clear to anna that there was nothing for anyone to be glad of that this laughter irritated her agonizingly and she would have liked to stop up her ears not to hear it at last the third bell rang there was a whistle and a hiss of steam and a clank of chains and the man in her carriage crossed himself it would be interesting to ask him what meaning he attaches to that thought anna looking angrily at him she looked past the lady out of the window at the people who seemed whirling by as they ran beside the train or stood on the platform the train jerking at regular intervals at the junctions of the rails rolled by the platform past a stone wall a signal box past other trains the wheels moving more smoothly and evenly resounded with a slight clang on the rails the window was lighted up by the bright evening sun and a slight breeze fluttered the curtain anna forgot her fellow passengers and to the light swaying of the train she fell to thinking again as she breathed the fresh air yes what did i stop at that i could not conceive a position in which life would not be a misery that we are all created to be miserable and that we all know it and all invent means of deceiving each other and when one sees the truth what is one to do thats what reason is given man for to escape from what worries him said the lady in french lisping affectedly and obviously pleased with her phrase the words seemed an answer to annas thoughts to escape from what worries him repeated anna and glancing at the red cheeked husband and the thin wife she saw that the sickly wife considered herself misunderstood and the husband deceived her and encouraged her in that idea of herself anna seemed to see all their history and all the crannies of their souls as it were turning a light upon them but there was nothing interesting in them and she pursued her thought yes i am very much worried and thats what reason was given me for to escape so then one must escape why not put out the light when theres nothing more to look at when it is sickening to look at it all but how why did the conductor run along the footboard why are they shrieking those young men in that train why are they talking why are they laughing it is all falsehood all lying all humbug all cruelty when the train came into the station anna got out into the crowd of passengers and moving apart from them as if they were lepers she stood on the platform trying to think what she had come here for and what she meant to do everything that had seemed to her possible before was now so difficult to consider especially in this noisy crowd of hideous people who would not leave her alone one moment porters ran up to her proffering their services then young men clacking their heels on the planks of the platform and talking loudly stared at her people meeting her dodged past on the wrong side remembering that she had meant to go on further if there were no answer she stopped a porter and asked if her coachman were not here with a note from count vronsky count vronsky they sent up here from the vronskys just this minute to meet princess sorokina and her daughter and what is the coachman like just as she was talking to the porter the coachman mihail red and cheerful in his smart blue coat and chain evidently proud of having so successfully performed his commission came up to her and gave her a letter she broke it open and her heart ached before she had read it i am very sorry your note did not reach me i will be home at ten vronsky had written carelessly yes thats what i expected she said to herself with an evil smile very good you can go home then she said softly addressing mihail she spoke softly because the rapidity of her hearts beating hindered her breathing no i will not let you make me miserable she thought menacingly addressing not him not herself but the power that made her suffer and she walked along the platform two maid servants walking along the platform turned their heads staring at her and making some remarks about her dress real they said of the lace she was wearing the young men would not leave her in peace again they passed by peering into her face and with a laugh shouting something in an unnatural voice the station master coming up asked her whether she was going by train a boy selling kvas never took his eyes off her my god where am i to go she thought going farther and farther along the platform at the end she stopped some ladies and children who had come to meet a gentleman in spectacles paused in their loud laughter and talking and stared at her as she reached them she quickened her pace and walked away from them to the edge of the platform a luggage train was coming in the platform began to sway and she fancied she was in the train again and all at once she thought of the man crushed by the train the day she had first met vronsky and she knew what she had to do with a rapid light step she went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails and stopped quite near the approaching train she looked at the lower part of the carriages at the screws and chains and the tall cast iron wheel of the first carriage slowly moving up and trying to measure the middle between the front and back wheels and the very minute when that middle point would be opposite her there she said to herself looking into the shadow of the carriage at the sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers there in the very middle and i will punish him and escape from everyone and from myself she tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it reached her but the red bag which she tried to drop out of her hand delayed her and she was too late she missed the moment she had to wait for the next carriage a feeling such as she had known when about to take the first plunge in bathing came upon her and she crossed herself that familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole series of girlish and childish memories and suddenly the darkness that had covered everything for her was torn apart and life rose up before her for an instant with all its bright past joys but she did not take her eyes from the wheels of the second carriage and exactly at the moment when the space between the wheels came opposite her she dropped the red bag and drawing her head back into her shoulders fell on her hands under the carriage and lightly as though she would rise again at once dropped on to her knees and at the same instant she was terror stricken at what she was doing where am i what am i doing what for she tried to get up to drop backwards but something huge and merciless struck her on the head and rolled her on her back lord forgive me all she said feeling it impossible to struggle a peasant muttering something was working at the iron above her and the light by which she had read the book filled with troubles falsehoods sorrow and evil flared up more brightly than ever before lighted up for her all that had been in darkness flickered began to grow dim and was quenched forever part eight chapter almost two months had passed the hot summer was half over but sergey ivanovitch was only just preparing to leave moscow sergey ivanovitchs life had not been uneventful during this time a year ago he had finished his book the fruit of six years labor sketch of a survey of the principles and forms of government in europe and russia several sections of this book and its introduction had appeared in periodical publications and other parts had been read by sergey ivanovitch to persons of his circle so that the leading ideas of the work could not be completely novel to the public but still sergey ivanovitch had expected that on its appearance his book would be sure to make a serious impression on society and if it did not cause a revolution in social science it would at any rate make a great stir in the scientific world after the most conscientious revision the book had last year been published and had been distributed among the booksellers though he asked no one about it reluctantly and with feigned indifference answered his friends inquiries as to how the book was going and did not even inquire of the booksellers how the book was selling sergey ivanovitch was all on the alert with strained attention watching for the first impression his book would make in the world and in literature but a week passed a second a third and in society no impression whatever could be detected his friends who were specialists and savants occasionally unmistakably from politeness alluded to it the rest of his acquaintances not interested in a book on a learned subject did not talk of it at all and society generally just now especially absorbed in other things was absolutely indifferent in the press too for a whole month there was not a word about his book sergey ivanovitch had calculated to a nicety the time necessary for writing a review but a month passed and a second and still there was silence only in the northern beetle in a comic article on the singer drabanti who had lost his voice there was a contemptuous allusion to koznishevs book suggesting that the book had been long ago seen through by everyone and was a subject of general ridicule at last in the third month a critical article appeared in a serious review sergey ivanovitch knew the author of the article he had met him once at golubtsovs the author of the article was a young man an invalid very bold as a writer but extremely deficient in breeding and shy in personal relations in spite of his absolute contempt for the author it was with complete respect that sergey ivanovitch set about reading the article the article was awful the critic had undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book which could not possibly be put on it but he had selected quotations so adroitly that for people who had not read the book and obviously scarcely anyone had read it it seemed absolutely clear that the whole book was nothing but a medley of high flown phrases not even as suggested by marks of interrogation used appropriately and that the author of the book was a person absolutely without knowledge of the subject and all this was so wittily done that sergey ivanovitch would not have disowned such wit himself but that was just what was so awful in spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which sergey ivanovitch verified the correctness of the critics arguments he did not for a minute stop to ponder over the faults and mistakes which were ridiculed but unconsciously he began immediately trying to recall every detail of his meeting and conversation with the author of the article did not i offend him in some way sergey ivanovitch wondered and remembering that when they met he had corrected the young man about something he had said that betrayed ignorance sergey ivanovitch found the clue to explain the article this article was followed by a deadly silence about the book both in the press and in conversation and sergey ivanovitch saw that his six years task toiled at with such love and labor had gone leaving no trace sergey ivanovitchs position was still more difficult from the fact that since he had finished his book he had had no more literary work to do such as had hitherto occupied the greater part of his time sergey ivanovitch was clever cultivated healthy and energetic and he did not know what use to make of his energy conversations in drawing rooms in meetings assemblies and committees everywhere where talk was possible took up part of his time but being used for years to town life he did not waste all his energies in talk as his less experienced younger brother did when he was in moscow he had a great deal of leisure and intellectual energy still to dispose of fortunately for him at this period so difficult for him from the failure of his book the various public questions of the dissenting sects of the american alliance of the samara famine of exhibitions and of spiritualism were definitely replaced in public interest by the slavonic question which had hitherto rather languidly interested society and sergey ivanovitch who had been one of the first to raise this subject threw himself into it heart and soul in the circle to which sergey ivanovitch belonged nothing was talked of or written about just now but the servian war everything that the idle crowd usually does to kill time was done now for the benefit of the slavonic states balls concerts dinners matchboxes ladies dresses beer restaurants everything testified to sympathy with the slavonic peoples from much of what was spoken and written on the subject sergey ivanovitch differed on various points he saw that the slavonic question had become one of those fashionable distractions which succeed one another in providing society with an object and an occupation he saw too that a great many people were taking up the subject from motives of self interest and self advertisement he recognized that the newspapers published a great deal that was superfluous and exaggerated with the sole aim of attracting attention and outbidding one another he saw that in this general movement those who thrust themselves most forward and shouted the loudest were men who had failed and were smarting under a sense of injury generals without armies ministers not in the ministry journalists not on any paper party leaders without followers he saw that there was a great deal in it that was frivolous and absurd but he saw and recognized an unmistakable growing enthusiasm uniting all classes with which it was impossible not to sympathize the massacre of men who were fellow christians and of the same slavonic race excited sympathy for the sufferers and indignation against the oppressors and the heroism of the servians and montenegrins struggling for a great cause begot in the whole people a longing to help their brothers not in word but in deed but in this there was another aspect that rejoiced sergey ivanovitch that was the manifestation of public opinion the public had definitely expressed its desire the soul of the people had as sergey ivanovitch said found expression and the more he worked in this cause the more incontestable it seemed to him that it was a cause destined to assume vast dimensions to create an epoch he threw himself heart and soul into the service of this great cause and forgot to think about his book his whole time now was engrossed by it so that he could scarcely manage to answer all the letters and appeals addressed to him he worked the whole spring and part of the summer and it was only in july that he prepared to go away to his brothers in the country he was going both to rest for a fortnight and in the very heart of the people in the farthest wilds of the country to enjoy the sight of that uplifting of the spirit of the people of which like all residents in the capital and big towns he was fully persuaded katavasov had long been meaning to carry out his promise to stay with levin and so he was going with him chapter sergey ivanovitch and katavasov had only just reached the station of the kursk line which was particularly busy and full of people that day when looking round for the groom who was following with their things they saw a party of volunteers driving up in four cabs ladies met them with bouquets of flowers and followed by the rushing crowd they went into the station one of the ladies who had met the volunteers came out of the hall and addressed sergey ivanovitch you too come to see them off she asked in french no i am going away myself princess to my brothers for a holiday do you always see them off said sergey ivanovitch with a hardly perceptible smile oh that would be impossible answered the princess is it true that eight hundred have been sent from us already malvinsky would not believe me more than eight hundred if you reckon those who have been sent not directly from moscow over a thousand answered sergey ivanovitch there thats just what i said exclaimed the lady and it is true too i suppose that more than a million has been subscribed yes princess what do you say to todays telegram beaten the turks again yes so i saw answered sergey ivanovitch they were speaking of the last telegram stating that the turks had been for three days in succession beaten at all points and put to flight and that tomorrow a decisive engagement was expected ah by the way a splendid young fellow has asked leave to go and they have made some difficulty i do not know why i meant to ask you i know him please write a note about his case hes being sent by countess lidia ivanovna sergey ivanovitch asked for all the details the princess knew about the young man and going into the first class waiting room wrote a note to the person on whom the granting of leave of absence depended and handed it to the princess you know count vronsky the notorious one is going by this train said the princess with a smile full of triumph and meaning when he found her again and gave her the letter i had heard he was going but i did not know when by this train i have seen him hes here theres only his mother seeing him off it is the best thing anyway that he could do oh yes of course while they were talking the crowd streamed by them into the dining room they went forward too and heard a gentleman with a glass in his hand delivering a loud discourse to the volunteers in the service of religion humanity and our brothers the gentleman said his voice growing louder and louder to this great cause mother moscow dedicates you with her blessing jivio he concluded loudly and tearfully everyone shouted jivio and a fresh crowd dashed into the hall almost carrying the princess off her legs ah princess that was something like said stepan arkadyevitch suddenly appearing in the middle of the crowd and beaming upon them with a delighted smile capitally warmly said was not it bravo and sergey ivanovitch why you ought to have said something just a few words you know to encourage them you do that so well he added with a soft respectful and discreet smile moving sergey ivanovitch forward a little by the arm no i am just off where to to the country to my brothers answered sergey ivanovitch then you will see my wife i have written to her but you will see her first please tell her that they have seen me and that it is all right as the english say she will understand oh and be so good as to tell her i am appointed secretary of the committee but she will understand you know les petites miseres de la vie humaine he said as it were apologizing to the princess and princess myakaya not liza but bibish is sending a thousand guns and twelve nurses did i tell you yes i heard so answered koznishev indifferently it is a pity you are going away said stepan arkadyevitch tomorrow we are giving a dinner to two who re setting off dimer bartnyansky from petersburg and our veslovsky grisha they are both going veslovskys only lately married theres a fine fellow for you eh princess he turned to the lady the princess looked at koznishev without replying but the fact that sergey ivanovitch and the princess seemed anxious to get rid of him did not in the least disconcert stepan arkadyevitch smiling he stared at the feather in the princesss hat and then about him as though he were going to pick something up seeing a lady approaching with a collecting box he beckoned her up and put in a five rouble note i can never see these collecting boxes unmoved while i have money in my pocket he said and how about todays telegram fine chaps those montenegrins you do not say so he cried when the princess told him that vronsky was going by this train for an instant stepan arkadyevitchs face looked sad but a minute later when stroking his mustaches and swinging as he walked he went into the hall where vronsky was he had completely forgotten his own despairing sobs over his sisters corpse and he saw in vronsky only a hero and an old friend with all his faults one cannot refuse to do him justice said the princess to sergey ivanovitch as soon as stepan arkadyevitch had left them what a typically russian slav nature only i am afraid it will not be pleasant for vronsky to see him say what you will i am touched by that mans fate do talk to him a little on the way said the princess yes perhaps if it happens so i never liked him but this atones for a great deal hes not merely going himself hes taking a squadron at his own expense yes so i heard a bell sounded everyone crowded to the doors here he is said the princess indicating vronsky who with his mother on his arm walked by wearing a long overcoat and wide brimmed black hat oblonsky was walking beside him talking eagerly of something vronsky was frowning and looking straight before him as though he did not hear what stepan arkadyevitch was saying probably on oblonskys pointing them out he looked round in the direction where the princess and sergey ivanovitch were standing and without speaking lifted his hat his face aged and worn by suffering looked stony going onto the platform vronsky left his mother and disappeared into a compartment on the platform there rang out god save the tsar then shouts of hurrah and jivio one of the volunteers a tall very young man with a hollow chest was particularly conspicuous bowing and waving his felt hat and a nosegay over his head then two officers emerged bowing too and a stout man with a big beard wearing a greasy forage cap chapter saying good bye to the princess sergey ivanovitch was joined by katavasov together they got into a carriage full to overflowing and the train started at tsaritsino station the train was met by a chorus of young men singing hail to thee again the volunteers bowed and poked their heads out but sergey ivanovitch paid no attention to them he had had so much to do with the volunteers that the type was familiar to him and did not interest him katavasov whose scientific work had prevented his having a chance of observing them hitherto was very much interested in them and questioned sergey ivanovitch sergey ivanovitch advised him to go into the second class and talk to them himself at the next station katavasov acted on this suggestion at the first stop he moved into the second class and made the acquaintance of the volunteers they were sitting in a corner of the carriage talking loudly and obviously aware that the attention of the passengers and katavasov as he got in was concentrated upon them more loudly than all talked the tall hollow chested young man he was unmistakably tipsy and was relating some story that had occurred at his school facing him sat a middle aged officer in the austrian military jacket of the guards uniform he was listening with a smile to the hollow chested youth and occasionally pulling him up the third in an artillery uniform was sitting on a box beside them a fourth was asleep entering into conversation with the youth katavasov learned that he was a wealthy moscow merchant who had run through a large fortune before he was two and twenty katavasov did not like him because he was unmanly and effeminate and sickly he was obviously convinced especially now after drinking that he was performing a heroic action and he bragged of it in the most unpleasant way the second the retired officer made an unpleasant impression too upon katavasov he was it seemed a man who had tried everything he had been on a railway had been a land steward and had started factories and he talked quite without necessity of all he had done and used learned expressions quite inappropriately the third the artilleryman on the contrary struck katavasov very favorably he was a quiet modest fellow unmistakably impressed by the knowledge of the officer and the heroic self sacrifice of the merchant and saying nothing about himself when katavasov asked him what had impelled him to go to servia he answered modestly oh well everyones going the servians want help too i am sorry for them yes you artillerymen especially are scarce there said katavasov oh i was not long in the artillery maybe they will put me into the infantry or the cavalry into the infantry when they need artillery more than anything said katavasov fancying from the artillerymans apparent age that he must have reached a fairly high grade i was not long in the artillery i am a cadet retired he said and he began to explain how he had failed in his examination all of this together made a disagreeable impression on katavasov and when the volunteers got out at a station for a drink katavasov would have liked to compare his unfavorable impression in conversation with someone there was an old man in the carriage wearing a military overcoat who had been listening all the while to katavasovs conversation with the volunteers when they were left alone katavasov addressed him what different positions they come from all those fellows who are going off there katavasov said vaguely not wishing to express his own opinion and at the same time anxious to find out the old mans views the old man was an officer who had served on two campaigns he knew what makes a soldier and judging by the appearance and the talk of those persons by the swagger with which they had recourse to the bottle on the journey he considered them poor soldiers moreover he lived in a district town and he was longing to tell how one soldier had volunteered from his town a drunkard and a thief whom no one would employ as a laborer but knowing by experience that in the present condition of the public temper it was dangerous to express an opinion opposed to the general one and especially to criticize the volunteers unfavorably he too watched katavasov without committing himself well men are wanted there he said laughing with his eyes and they fell to talking of the last war news and each concealed from the other his perplexity as to the engagement expected next day since the turks had been beaten according to the latest news at all points and so they parted neither giving expression to his opinion katavasov went back to his own carriage and with reluctant hypocrisy reported to sergey ivanovitch his observations of the volunteers from which it would appear that they were capital fellows at a big station at a town the volunteers were again greeted with shouts and singing again men and women with collecting boxes appeared and provincial ladies brought bouquets to the volunteers and followed them into the refreshment room but all this was on a much smaller and feebler scale than in moscow chapter while the train was stopping at the provincial town sergey ivanovitch did not go to the refreshment room but walked up and down the platform the first time he passed vronskys compartment he noticed that the curtain was drawn over the window but as he passed it the second time he saw the old countess at the window she beckoned to koznishev i am going you see taking him as far as kursk she said yes so i heard said sergey ivanovitch standing at her window and peeping in what a noble act on his part he added noticing that vronsky was not in the compartment yes after his misfortune what was there for him to do what a terrible thing it was said sergey ivanovitch ah what i have been through but do get in ah what i have been through she repeated when sergey ivanovitch had got in and sat down beside her you cannot conceive it for six weeks he did not speak to anyone and would not touch food except when i implored him and not for one minute could we leave him alone we took away everything he could have used against himself we lived on the ground floor but there was no reckoning on anything you know of course that he had shot himself once already on her account she said and the old ladys eyelashes twitched at the recollection yes hers was the fitting end for such a woman even the death she chose was low and vulgar it is not for us to judge countess said sergey ivanovitch but i can understand that it has been very hard for you ah do not speak of it i was staying on my estate and he was with me a note was brought him he wrote an answer and sent it off we had not an idea that she was close by at the station in the evening i had only just gone to my room when my mary told me a lady had thrown herself under the train something seemed to strike me at once i knew it was she the first thing i said was he was not to be told but they had told him already his coachman was there and saw it all when i ran into his room he was beside himself it was fearful to see him he did not say a word but galloped off there i do not know to this day what happened there but he was brought back at deaths door i should not have known him prostration complete the doctor said and that was followed almost by madness oh why talk of it said the countess with a wave of her hand it was an awful time no say what you will she was a bad woman why what is the meaning of such desperate passions it was all to show herself something out of the way well and that she did do she brought herself to ruin and two good men her husband and my unhappy son and what did her husband do asked sergey ivanovitch he has taken her daughter alexey was ready to agree to anything at first now it worries him terribly that he should have given his own child away to another man but he cannot take back his word karenin came to the funeral but we tried to prevent his meeting alexey for him for her husband it was easier anyway she had set him free but my poor son was utterly given up to her he had thrown up everything his career me and even then she had no mercy on him but of set purpose she made his ruin complete no say what you will her very death was the death of a vile woman of no religious feeling god forgive me but i cannot help hating the memory of her when i look at my sons misery but how is he now it was a blessing from providence for us this servian war i am old and i do not understand the rights and wrongs of it but it is come as a providential blessing to him of course for me as his mother it is terrible and whats worse they say ce ne est pas tres bien vu a petersbourg but it cannot be helped it was the one thing that could rouse him yashvin a friend of his he had lost all he had at cards and he was going to servia he came to see him and persuaded him to go now it is an interest for him do please talk to him a little i want to distract his mind hes so low spirited and as bad luck would have it he has toothache too but he will be delighted to see you please do talk to him hes walking up and down on that side sergey ivanovitch said he would be very glad to and crossed over to the other side of the station chapter in the slanting evening shadows cast by the baggage piled up on the platform vronsky in his long overcoat and slouch hat with his hands in his pockets strode up and down like a wild beast in a cage turning sharply after twenty paces sergey ivanovitch fancied as he approached him that vronsky saw him but was pretending not to see this did not affect sergey ivanovitch in the slightest he was above all personal considerations with vronsky at that moment sergey ivanovitch looked upon vronsky as a man taking an important part in a great cause and koznishev thought it his duty to encourage him and express his approval he went up to him vronsky stood still looked intently at him recognized him and going a few steps forward to meet him shook hands with him very warmly possibly you did not wish to see me said sergey ivanovitch but could not i be of use to you theres no one i should less dislike seeing than you said vronsky excuse me and theres nothing in life for me to like i quite understand and i merely meant to offer you my services said sergey ivanovitch scanning vronskys face full of unmistakable suffering would not it be of use to you to have a letter to ristitch to milan oh no vronsky said seeming to understand him with difficulty if you do not mind lets walk on it is so stuffy among the carriages a letter no thank you to meet death one needs no letters of introduction nor for the turks he said with a smile that was merely of the lips his eyes still kept their look of angry suffering yes but you might find it easier to get into relations which are after all essential with anyone prepared to see you but thats as you like i was very glad to hear of your intention there have been so many attacks made on the volunteers and a man like you raises them in public estimation my use as a man said vronsky is that lifes worth nothing to me and that i have enough bodily energy to cut my way into their ranks and to trample on them or fall i know that i am glad theres something to give my life for for it is not simply useless but loathsome to me anyones welcome to it and his jaw twitched impatiently from the incessant gnawing toothache that prevented him from even speaking with a natural expression you will become another man i predict said sergey ivanovitch feeling touched to deliver ones brother men from bondage is an aim worth death and life god grant you success outwardly and inwardly peace he added and he held out his hand vronsky warmly pressed his outstretched hand yes as a weapon i may be of some use but as a man i am a wreck he jerked out he could hardly speak for the throbbing ache in his strong teeth that were like rows of ivory in his mouth he was silent and his eyes rested on the wheels of the tender slowly and smoothly rolling along the rails and all at once a different pain not an ache but an inner trouble that set his whole being in anguish made him for an instant forget his toothache as he glanced at the tender and the rails under the influence of the conversation with a friend he had not met since his misfortune he suddenly recalled her that is what was left of her when he had run like one distraught into the cloak room of the railway station on the table shamelessly sprawling out among strangers the bloodstained body so lately full of life the head unhurt dropping back with its weight of hair and the curling tresses about the temples and the exquisite face with red half opened mouth the strange fixed expression piteous on the lips and awful in the still open eyes that seemed to utter that fearful phrase that he would be sorry for it that she had said when they were quarreling and he tried to think of her as she was when he met her the first time at a railway station too mysterious exquisite loving seeking and giving happiness and not cruelly revengeful as he remembered her on that last moment he tried to recall his best moments with her but those moments were poisoned forever he could only think of her as triumphant successful in her menace of a wholly useless remorse never to be effaced he lost all consciousness of toothache and his face worked with sobs passing twice up and down beside the baggage in silence and regaining his self possession he addressed sergey ivanovitch calmly you have had no telegrams since yesterdays yes driven back for a third time but a decisive engagement expected for tomorrow and after talking a little more of king milans proclamation and the immense effect it might have they parted going to their carriages on hearing the second bell chapter sergey ivanovitch had not telegraphed to his brother to send to meet him as he did not know when he should be able to leave moscow levin was not at home when katavasov and sergey ivanovitch in a fly hired at the station drove up to the steps of the pokrovskoe house as black as moors from the dust of the road kitty sitting on the balcony with her father and sister recognized her brother in law and ran down to meet him what a shame not to have let us know she said giving her hand to sergey ivanovitch and putting her forehead up for him to kiss we drove here capitally and have not put you out answered sergey ivanovitch i am so dirty i am afraid to touch you i have been so busy i did not know when i should be able to tear myself away and so you are still as ever enjoying your peaceful quiet happiness he said smiling out of the reach of the current in your peaceful backwater heres our friend fyodor vassilievitch who has succeeded in getting here at last but i am not a negro i shall look like a human being when i wash said katavasov in his jesting fashion and he shook hands and smiled his teeth flashing white in his black face kostya will be delighted he has gone to his settlement it is time he should be home busy as ever with his farming it really is a peaceful backwater said katavasov while we in town think of nothing but the servian war well how does our friend look at it hes sure not to think like other people oh i do not know like everybody else kitty answered a little embarrassed looking round at sergey ivanovitch i will send to fetch him papas staying with us hes only just come home from abroad and making arrangements to send for levin and for the guests to wash one in his room and the other in what had been dollys and giving orders for their luncheon kitty ran out onto the balcony enjoying the freedom and rapidity of movement of which she had been deprived during the months of her pregnancy it is sergey ivanovitch and katavasov a professor she said oh thats a bore in this heat said the prince no papa hes very nice and kostyas very fond of him kitty said with a deprecating smile noticing the irony on her fathers face oh i did not say anything you go to them darling said kitty to her sister and entertain them they saw stiva at the station he was quite well and i must run to mitya as ill luck would have it i have not fed him since tea hes awake now and sure to be screaming and feeling a rush of milk she hurried to the nursery this was not a mere guess her connection with the child was still so close that she could gauge by the flow of her milk his need of food and knew for certain he was hungry she knew he was crying before she reached the nursery and he was indeed crying she heard him and hastened but the faster she went the louder he screamed it was a fine healthy scream hungry and impatient has he been screaming long nurse very long said kitty hurriedly seating herself on a chair and preparing to give the baby the breast but give me him quickly oh nurse how tiresome you are there tie the cap afterwards do the babys greedy scream was passing into sobs but you cannot manage so madam said agafea mihalovna who was almost always to be found in the nursery he must be put straight a oo a oo she chanted over him paying no attention to the mother the nurse brought the baby to his mother agafea mihalovna followed him with a face dissolving with tenderness he knows me he knows me in gods faith katerina alexandrovna madam he knew me agafea mihalovna cried above the babys screams but kitty did not hear her words her impatience kept growing like the babys their impatience hindered things for a while the baby could not get hold of the breast right and was furious at last after despairing breathless screaming and vain sucking things went right and mother and child felt simultaneously soothed and both subsided into calm but poor darling hes all in perspiration said kitty in a whisper touching the baby what makes you think he knows you she added with a sidelong glance at the babys eyes that peered roguishly as she fancied from under his cap at his rhythmically puffing cheeks and the little red palmed hand he was waving impossible if he knew anyone he would have known me said kitty in response to agafea mihalovnas statement and she smiled she smiled because though she said he could not know her in her heart she was sure that he knew not merely agafea mihalovna but that he knew and understood everything and knew and understood a great deal too that no one else knew and that she his mother had learned and come to understand only through him to agafea mihalovna to the nurse to his grandfather to his father even mitya was a living being requiring only material care but for his mother he had long been a mortal being with whom there had been a whole series of spiritual relations already when he wakes up please god you shall see for yourself then when i do like this he simply beams on me the darling simply beams like a sunny day said agafea mihalovna well well then we shall see whispered kitty but now go away hes going to sleep chapter agafea mihalovna went out on tiptoe the nurse let down the blind chased a fly out from under the muslin canopy of the crib and a bumblebee struggling on the window frame and sat down waving a faded branch of birch over the mother and the baby how hot it is if god would send a drop of rain she said yes yes sh sh sh was all kitty answered rocking a little and tenderly squeezing the plump little arm with rolls of fat at the wrist which mitya still waved feebly as he opened and shut his eyes that hand worried kitty she longed to kiss the little hand but was afraid to for fear of waking the baby at last the little hand ceased waving and the eyes closed only from time to time as he went on sucking the baby raised his long curly eyelashes and peeped at his mother with wet eyes that looked black in the twilight the nurse had left off fanning and was dozing from above came the peals of the old princes voice and the chuckle of katavasov they have got into talk without me thought kitty but still it is vexing that kostyas out hes sure to have gone to the bee house again though it is a pity hes there so often still i am glad it distracts his mind hes become altogether happier and better now than in the spring he used to be so gloomy and worried that i felt frightened for him and how absurd he is she whispered smiling she knew what worried her husband it was his unbelief although if she had been asked whether she supposed that in the future life if he did not believe he would be damned she would have had to admit that he would be damned his unbelief did not cause her unhappiness and she confessing that for an unbeliever there can be no salvation and loving her husbands soul more than anything in the world thought with a smile of his unbelief and told herself that he was absurd what does he keep reading philosophy of some sort for all this year she wondered if it is all written in those books he can understand them if it is all wrong why does he read them he says himself that he would like to believe then why is it he does not believe surely from his thinking so much and he thinks so much from being solitary hes always alone alone he cannot talk about it all to us i fancy he will be glad of these visitors especially katavasov he likes discussions with them she thought and passed instantly to the consideration of where it would be more convenient to put katavasov to sleep alone or to share sergey ivanovitchs room and then an idea suddenly struck her which made her shudder and even disturb mitya who glanced severely at her i do believe the laundress has not sent the washing yet and all the best sheets are in use if i do not see to it agafea mihalovna will give sergey ivanovitch the wrong sheets and at the very idea of this the blood rushed to kittys face yes i will arrange it she decided and going back to her former thoughts she remembered that some spiritual question of importance had been interrupted and she began to recall what yes kostya an unbeliever she thought again with a smile well an unbeliever then better let him always be one than like madame stahl or what i tried to be in those days abroad no he will not ever sham anything and a recent instance of his goodness rose vividly to her mind a fortnight ago a penitent letter had come from stepan arkadyevitch to dolly he besought her to save his honor to sell her estate to pay his debts dolly was in despair she detested her husband despised him pitied him resolved on a separation resolved to refuse but ended by agreeing to sell part of her property after that with an irrepressible smile of tenderness kitty recalled her husbands shamefaced embarrassment his repeated awkward efforts to approach the subject and how at last having thought of the one means of helping dolly without wounding her pride he had suggested to kitty what had not occurred to her before that she should give up her share of the property he an unbeliever indeed with his heart his dread of offending anyone even a child everything for others nothing for himself sergey ivanovitch simply considers it as kostyas duty to be his steward and it is the same with his sister now dolly and her children are under his guardianship all these peasants who come to him every day as though he were bound to be at their service yes only be like your father only like him she said handing mitya over to the nurse and putting her lips to his cheek chapter ever since by his beloved brothers deathbed levin had first glanced into the questions of life and death in the light of these new convictions as he called them which had during the period from his twentieth to his thirty fourth year imperceptibly replaced his childish and youthful beliefs he had been stricken with horror not so much of death as of life without any knowledge of whence and why and how and what it was the physical organization its decay the indestructibility of matter the law of the conservation of energy evolution were the words which usurped the place of his old belief these words and the ideas associated with them were very well for intellectual purposes but for life they yielded nothing and levin felt suddenly like a man who has changed his warm fur cloak for a muslin garment and going for the first time into the frost is immediately convinced not by reason but by his whole nature that he is as good as naked and that he must infallibly perish miserably from that moment though he did not distinctly face it and still went on living as before levin had never lost this sense of terror at his lack of knowledge he vaguely felt too that what he called his new convictions were not merely lack of knowledge but that they were part of a whole order of ideas in which no knowledge of what he needed was possible at first marriage with the new joys and duties bound up with it had completely crowded out these thoughts but of late while he was staying in moscow after his wifes confinement with nothing to do the question that clamored for solution had more and more often more and more insistently haunted levins mind the question was summed up for him thus if i do not accept the answers christianity gives to the problems of my life what answers do i accept and in the whole arsenal of his convictions so far from finding any satisfactory answers he was utterly unable to find anything at all like an answer he was in the position of a man seeking food in toy shops and tool shops instinctively unconsciously with every book with every conversation with every man he met he was on the lookout for light on these questions and their solution what puzzled and distracted him above everything was that the majority of men of his age and circle had like him exchanged their old beliefs for the same new convictions and yet saw nothing to lament in this and were perfectly satisfied and serene so that apart from the principal question levin was tortured by other questions too were these people sincere he asked himself or were they playing a part or was it that they understood the answers science gave to these problems in some different clearer sense than he did and he assiduously studied both these mens opinions and the books which treated of these scientific explanations one fact he had found out since these questions had engrossed his mind was that he had been quite wrong in supposing from the recollections of the circle of his young days at college that religion had outlived its day and that it was now practically non existent all the people nearest to him who were good in their lives were believers the old prince and lvov whom he liked so much and sergey ivanovitch and all the women believed and his wife believed as simply as he had believed in his earliest childhood and ninety nine hundredths of the russian people all the working people for whose life he felt the deepest respect believed another fact of which he became convinced after reading many scientific books was that the men who shared his views had no other construction to put on them and that they gave no explanation of the questions which he felt he could not live without answering but simply ignored their existence and attempted to explain other questions of no possible interest to him such as the evolution of organisms the materialistic theory of consciousness and so forth moreover during his wifes confinement something had happened that seemed extraordinary to him he an unbeliever had fallen into praying and at the moment he prayed he believed but that moment had passed and he could not make his state of mind at that moment fit into the rest of his life he could not admit that at that moment he knew the truth and that now he was wrong for as soon as he began thinking calmly about it it all fell to pieces he could not admit that he was mistaken then for his spiritual condition then was precious to him and to admit that it was a proof of weakness would have been to desecrate those moments he was miserably divided against himself and strained all his spiritual forces to the utmost to escape from this condition chapter these doubts fretted and harassed him growing weaker or stronger from time to time but never leaving him he read and thought and the more he read and the more he thought the further he felt from the aim he was pursuing of late in moscow and in the country since he had become convinced that he would find no solution in the materialists he had read and re read thoroughly plato spinoza kant schelling hegel and schopenhauer the philosophers who gave a non materialistic explanation of life their ideas seemed to him fruitful when he was reading or was himself seeking arguments to refute other theories especially those of the materialists but as soon as he began to read or sought for himself a solution of problems the same thing always happened as long as he followed the fixed definition of obscure words such as spirit will freedom essence purposely letting himself go into the snare of words the philosophers set for him he seemed to comprehend something but he had only to forget the artificial train of reasoning and to turn from life itself to what had satisfied him while thinking in accordance with the fixed definitions and all this artificial edifice fell to pieces at once like a house of cards and it became clear that the edifice had been built up out of those transposed words apart from anything in life more important than reason at one time reading schopenhauer he put in place of his will the word love and for a couple of days this new philosophy charmed him till he removed a little away from it but then when he turned from life itself to glance at it again it fell away too and proved to be the same muslin garment with no warmth in it his brother sergey ivanovitch advised him to read the theological works of homiakov levin read the second volume of homiakovs works and in spite of the elegant epigrammatic argumentative style which at first repelled him he was impressed by the doctrine of the church he found in them he was struck at first by the idea that the apprehension of divine truths had not been vouchsafed to man but to a corporation of men bound together by love to the church what delighted him was the thought how much easier it was to believe in a still existing living church embracing all the beliefs of men and having god at its head and therefore holy and infallible and from it to accept the faith in god in the creation the fall the redemption than to begin with god a mysterious far away god the creation etc but afterwards on reading a catholic writers history of the church and then a greek orthodox writers history of the church and seeing that the two churches in their very conception infallible each deny the authority of the other homiakovs doctrine of the church lost all its charm for him and this edifice crumbled into dust like the philosophers edifices all that spring he was not himself and went through fearful moments of horror without knowing what i am and why i am here lifes impossible and that i cannot know and so i cannot live levin said to himself in infinite time in infinite matter in infinite space is formed a bubble organism and that bubble lasts a while and bursts and that bubble is me it was an agonizing error but it was the sole logical result of ages of human thought in that direction this was the ultimate belief on which all the systems elaborated by human thought in almost all their ramifications rested it was the prevalent conviction and of all other explanations levin had unconsciously not knowing when or how chosen it as anyway the clearest and made it his own but it was not merely a falsehood it was the cruel jeer of some wicked power some evil hateful power to whom one could not submit he must escape from this power and the means of escape every man had in his own hands he had but to cut short this dependence on evil and there was one means death and levin a happy father and husband in perfect health was several times so near suicide that he hid the cord that he might not be tempted to hang himself and was afraid to go out with his gun for fear of shooting himself but levin did not shoot himself and did not hang himself he went on living chapter when levin thought what he was and what he was living for he could find no answer to the questions and was reduced to despair but he left off questioning himself about it it seemed as though he knew both what he was and for what he was living for he acted and lived resolutely and without hesitation indeed in these latter days he was far more decided and unhesitating in life than he had ever been when he went back to the country at the beginning of june he went back also to his usual pursuits the management of the estate his relations with the peasants and the neighbors the care of his household the management of his sisters and brothers property of which he had the direction his relations with his wife and kindred the care of his child and the new bee keeping hobby he had taken up that spring filled all his time these things occupied him now not because he justified them to himself by any sort of general principles as he had done in former days on the contrary disappointed by the failure of his former efforts for the general welfare and too much occupied with his own thought and the mass of business with which he was burdened from all sides he had completely given up thinking of the general good and he busied himself with all this work simply because it seemed to him that he must do what he was doing that he could not do otherwise in former days almost from childhood and increasingly up to full manhood when he had tried to do anything that would be good for all for humanity for russia for the whole village he had noticed that the idea of it had been pleasant but the work itself had always been incoherent that then he had never had a full conviction of its absolute necessity and that the work that had begun by seeming so great had grown less and less till it vanished into nothing but now since his marriage when he had begun to confine himself more and more to living for himself though he experienced no delight at all at the thought of the work he was doing he felt a complete conviction of its necessity saw that it succeeded far better than in old days and that it kept on growing more and more now involuntarily it seemed he cut more and more deeply into the soil like a plough so that he could not be drawn out without turning aside the furrow to live the same family life as his father and forefathers that is in the same condition of culture and to bring up his children in the same was incontestably necessary it was as necessary as dining when one was hungry and to do this just as it was necessary to cook dinner it was necessary to keep the mechanism of agriculture at pokrovskoe going so as to yield an income just as incontestably as it was necessary to repay a debt was it necessary to keep the property in such a condition that his son when he received it as a heritage would say thank you to his father as levin had said thank you to his grandfather for all he built and planted and to do this it was necessary to look after the land himself not to let it and to breed cattle manure the fields and plant timber it was impossible not to look after the affairs of sergey ivanovitch of his sister of the peasants who came to him for advice and were accustomed to do so as impossible as to fling down a child one is carrying in ones arms it was necessary to look after the comfort of his sister in law and her children and of his wife and baby and it was impossible not to spend with them at least a short time each day and all this together with shooting and his new bee keeping filled up the whole of levins life which had no meaning at all for him when he began to think but besides knowing thoroughly what he had to do levin knew in just the same way how he had to do it all and what was more important than the rest he knew he must hire laborers as cheaply as possible but to hire men under bond paying them in advance at less than the current rate of wages was what he must not do even though it was very profitable selling straw to the peasants in times of scarcity of provender was what he might do even though he felt sorry for them but the tavern and the pothouse must be put down though they were a source of income felling timber must be punished as severely as possible but he could not exact forfeits for cattle being driven onto his fields and though it annoyed the keeper and made the peasants not afraid to graze their cattle on his land he could not keep their cattle as a punishment to pyotr who was paying a money lender ten per cent a month he must lend a sum of money to set him free but he could not let off peasants who did not pay their rent nor let them fall into arrears it was impossible to overlook the bailiffs not having mown the meadows and letting the hay spoil and it was equally impossible to mow those acres where a young copse had been planted it was impossible to excuse a laborer who had gone home in the busy season because his father was dying however sorry he might feel for him and he must subtract from his pay those costly months of idleness but it was impossible not to allow monthly rations to the old servants who were of no use for anything levin knew that when he got home he must first of all go to his wife who was unwell and that the peasants who had been waiting for three hours to see him could wait a little longer he knew too that regardless of all the pleasure he felt in taking a swarm he must forego that pleasure and leave the old man to see to the bees alone while he talked to the peasants who had come after him to the bee house whether he were acting rightly or wrongly he did not know and far from trying to prove that he was nowadays he avoided all thought or talk about it reasoning had brought him to doubt and prevented him from seeing what he ought to do and what he ought not when he did not think but simply lived he was continually aware of the presence of an infallible judge in his soul determining which of two possible courses of action was the better and which was the worse and as soon as he did not act rightly he was at once aware of it so he lived not knowing and not seeing any chance of knowing what he was and what he was living for and harassed at this lack of knowledge to such a point that he was afraid of suicide and yet firmly laying down his own individual definite path in life chapter the day on which sergey ivanovitch came to pokrovskoe was one of levins most painful days it was the very busiest working time when all the peasantry show an extraordinary intensity of self sacrifice in labor such as is never shown in any other conditions of life and would be highly esteemed if the men who showed these qualities themselves thought highly of them and if it were not repeated every year and if the results of this intense labor were not so simple to reap and bind the rye and oats and to carry it to mow the meadows turn over the fallows thrash the seed and sow the winter corn all this seems so simple and ordinary but to succeed in getting through it all everyone in the village from the old man to the young child must toil incessantly for three or four weeks three times as hard as usual living on rye beer onions and black bread thrashing and carrying the sheaves at night and not giving more than two or three hours in the twenty four to sleep and every year this is done all over russia having lived the greater part of his life in the country and in the closest relations with the peasants levin always felt in this busy time that he was infected by this general quickening of energy in the people in the early morning he rode over to the first sowing of the rye and to the oats which were being carried to the stacks and returning home at the time his wife and sister in law were getting up he drank coffee with them and walked to the farm where a new thrashing machine was to be set working to get ready the seed corn he was standing in the cool granary still fragrant with the leaves of the hazel branches interlaced on the freshly peeled aspen beams of the new thatch roof he gazed through the open door in which the dry bitter dust of the thrashing whirled and played at the grass of the thrashing floor in the sunlight and the fresh straw that had been brought in from the barn then at the speckly headed white breasted swallows that flew chirping in under the roof and fluttering their wings settled in the crevices of the doorway then at the peasants bustling in the dark dusty barn and he thought strange thoughts why is it all being done he thought why am i standing here making them work what are they all so busy for trying to show their zeal before me what is that old matrona my old friend toiling for i doctored her when the beam fell on her in the fire he thought looking at a thin old woman who was raking up the grain moving painfully with her bare sun blackened feet over the uneven rough floor then she recovered but today or tomorrow or in ten years she will not they will bury her and nothing will be left either of her or of that smart girl in the red jacket who with that skillful soft action shakes the ears out of their husks they will bury her and this piebald horse and very soon too he thought gazing at the heavily moving panting horse that kept walking up the wheel that turned under him and they will bury her and fyodor the thrasher with his curly beard full of chaff and his shirt torn on his white shoulders they will bury him hes untying the sheaves and giving orders and shouting to the women and quickly setting straight the strap on the moving wheel and whats more it is not them alone me they will bury too and nothing will be left what for he thought this and at the same time looked at his watch to reckon how much they thrashed in an hour he wanted to know this so as to judge by it the task to set for the day it will soon be one and they are only beginning the third sheaf thought levin he went up to the man that was feeding the machine and shouting over the roar of the machine he told him to put it in more slowly you put in too much at a time fyodor do you see it gets choked thats why it is not getting on do it evenly fyodor black with the dust that clung to his moist face shouted something in response but still went on doing it as levin did not want him to levin going up to the machine moved fyodor aside and began feeding the corn in himself working on till the peasants dinner hour which was not long in coming he went out of the barn with fyodor and fell into talk with him stopping beside a neat yellow sheaf of rye laid on the thrashing floor for seed fyodor came from a village at some distance from the one in which levin had once allotted land to his cooperative association now it had been let to a former house porter levin talked to fyodor about this land and asked whether platon a well to do peasant of good character belonging to the same village would not take the land for the coming year it is a high rent it would not pay platon konstantin dmitrievitch answered the peasant picking the ears off his sweat drenched shirt but how does kirillov make it pay mituh so the peasant called the house porter in a tone of contempt you may be sure he will make it pay konstantin dmitrievitch he will get his share however he has to squeeze to get it hes no mercy on a christian but uncle fokanitch so he called the old peasant platon do you suppose he had flay the skin off a man where theres debt he will let anyone off and he will not wring the last penny out hes a man too but why will he let anyone off oh well of course folks are different one man lives for his own wants and nothing else like mituh he only thinks of filling his belly but fokanitch is a righteous man he lives for his soul he does not forget god how thinks of god how does he live for his soul levin almost shouted why to be sure in truth in gods way folks are different take you now you would not wrong a man yes yes good bye said levin breathless with excitement and turning round he took his stick and walked quickly away towards home at the peasants words that fokanitch lived for his soul in truth in gods way undefined but significant ideas seemed to burst out as though they had been locked up and all striving towards one goal they thronged whirling through his head blinding him with their light chapter levin strode along the highroad absorbed not so much in his thoughts he could not yet disentangle them as in his spiritual condition unlike anything he had experienced before the words uttered by the peasant had acted on his soul like an electric shock suddenly transforming and combining into a single whole the whole swarm of disjointed impotent separate thoughts that incessantly occupied his mind these thoughts had unconsciously been in his mind even when he was talking about the land he was aware of something new in his soul and joyfully tested this new thing not yet knowing what it was not living for his own wants but for god for what god and could one say anything more senseless than what he said he said that one must not live for ones own wants that is that one must not live for what we understand what we are attracted by what we desire but must live for something incomprehensible for god whom no one can understand nor even define what of it did not i understand those senseless words of fyodors and understanding them did i doubt of their truth did i think them stupid obscure inexact no i understood him and exactly as he understands the words i understood them more fully and clearly than i understand anything in life and never in my life have i doubted nor can i doubt about it and not only i but everyone the whole world understands nothing fully but this and about this only they have no doubt and are always agreed and i looked out for miracles complained that i did not see a miracle which would convince me a material miracle would have persuaded me and here is a miracle the sole miracle possible continually existing surrounding me on all sides and i never noticed it fyodor says that kirillov lives for his belly thats comprehensible and rational all of us as rational beings cannot do anything else but live for our belly and all of a sudden the same fyodor says that one must not live for ones belly but must live for truth for god and at a hint i understand him and i and millions of men men who lived ages ago and men living now peasants the poor in spirit and the learned who have thought and written about it in their obscure words saying the same thing we are all agreed about this one thing what we must live for and what is good i and all men have only one firm incontestable clear knowledge and that knowledge cannot be explained by the reason it is outside it and has no causes and can have no effects if goodness has causes it is not goodness if it has effects a reward it is not goodness either so goodness is outside the chain of cause and effect and yet i know it and we all know it what could be a greater miracle than that can i have found the solution of it all can my sufferings be over thought levin striding along the dusty road not noticing the heat nor his weariness and experiencing a sense of relief from prolonged suffering this feeling was so delicious that it seemed to him incredible he was breathless with emotion and incapable of going farther he turned off the road into the forest and lay down in the shade of an aspen on the uncut grass he took his hat off his hot head and lay propped on his elbow in the lush feathery woodland grass yes i must make it clear to myself and understand he thought looking intently at the untrampled grass before him and following the movements of a green beetle advancing along a blade of couch grass and lifting up in its progress a leaf of goat weed what have i discovered he asked himself bending aside the leaf of goat weed out of the beetles way and twisting another blade of grass above for the beetle to cross over onto it what is it makes me glad what have i discovered i have discovered nothing i have only found out what i knew i understand the force that in the past gave me life and now too gives me life i have been set free from falsity i have found the master of old i used to say that in my body that in the body of this grass and of this beetle there she did not care for the grass shes opened her wings and flown away there was going on a transformation of matter in accordance with physical chemical and physiological laws and in all of us as well as in the aspens and the clouds and the misty patches there was a process of evolution evolution from what into what eternal evolution and struggle as though there could be any sort of tendency and struggle in the eternal and i was astonished that in spite of the utmost effort of thought along that road i could not discover the meaning of life the meaning of my impulses and yearnings now i say that i know the meaning of my life to live for god for my soule and this meaning in spite of its clearness is mysterious and marvelous such indeed is the meaning of everything existing yes pride he said to himself turning over on his stomach and beginning to tie a noose of blades of grass trying not to break them and not merely pride of intellect but dulness of intellect and most of all the deceitfulness yes the deceitfulness of intellect the cheating knavishness of intellect thats it he said to himself and he briefly went through mentally the whole course of his ideas during the last two years the beginning of which was the clear confronting of death at the sight of his dear brother hopelessly ill then for the first time grasping that for every man and himself too there was nothing in store but suffering death and forgetfulness he had made up his mind that life was impossible like that and that he must either interpret life so that it would not present itself to him as the evil jest of some devil or shoot himself but he had not done either but had gone on living thinking and feeling and had even at that very time married and had had many joys and had been happy when he was not thinking of the meaning of his life what did this mean it meant that he had been living rightly but thinking wrongly he had lived without being aware of it on those spiritual truths that he had sucked in with his mothers milk but he had thought not merely without recognition of these truths but studiously ignoring them now it was clear to him that he could only live by virtue of the beliefs in which he had been brought up what should i have been and how should i have spent my life if i had not had these beliefs if i had not known that i must live for god and not for my own desires i should have robbed and lied and killed nothing of what makes the chief happiness of my life would have existed for me and with the utmost stretch of imagination he could not conceive the brutal creature he would have been himself if he had not known what he was living for i looked for an answer to my question and thought could not give an answer to my question it is incommensurable with my question the answer has been given me by life itself in my knowledge of what is right and what is wrong and that knowledge i did not arrive at in any way it was given to me as to all men given because i could not have got it from anywhere where could i have got it by reason could i have arrived at knowing that i must love my neighbor and not oppress him i was told that in my childhood and i believed it gladly for they told me what was already in my soul but who discovered it not reason reason discovered the struggle for existence and the law that requires us to oppress all who hinder the satisfaction of our desires that is the deduction of reason but loving ones neighbor reason could never discover because it is irrational chapter and levin remembered a scene he had lately witnessed between dolly and her children the children left to themselves had begun cooking raspberries over the candles and squirting milk into each others mouths with a syringe their mother catching them at these pranks began reminding them in levins presence of the trouble their mischief gave to the grown up people and that this trouble was all for their sake and that if they smashed the cups they would have nothing to drink their tea out of and that if they wasted the milk they would have nothing to eat and die of hunger and levin had been struck by the passive weary incredulity with which the children heard what their mother said to them they were simply annoyed that their amusing play had been interrupted and did not believe a word of what their mother was saying they could not believe it indeed for they could not take in the immensity of all they habitually enjoyed and so could not conceive that what they were destroying was the very thing they lived by that all comes of itself they thought and theres nothing interesting or important about it because it has always been so and always will be so and it is all always the same we have no need to think about that it is all ready but we want to invent something of our own and new so we thought of putting raspberries in a cup and cooking them over a candle and squirting milk straight into each others mouths thats fun and something new and not a bit worse than drinking out of cups is not it just the same that we do that i did searching by the aid of reason for the significance of the forces of nature and the meaning of the life of man he thought and do not all the theories of philosophy do the same trying by the path of thought which is strange and not natural to man to bring him to a knowledge of what he has known long ago and knows so certainly that he could not live at all without it is not it distinctly to be seen in the development of each philosophers theory that he knows what is the chief significance of life beforehand just as positively as the peasant fyodor and not a bit more clearly than he and is simply trying by a dubious intellectual path to come back to what everyone knows now then leave the children to themselves to get things alone and make their crockery get the milk from the cows and so on would they be naughty then why they had die of hunger well then leave us with our passions and thoughts without any idea of the one god of the creator or without any idea of what is right without any idea of moral evil just try and build up anything without those ideas we only try to destroy them because we are spiritually provided for exactly like the children whence have i that joyful knowledge shared with the peasant that alone gives peace to my soul whence did i get it brought up with an idea of god a christian my whole life filled with the spiritual blessings christianity has given me full of them and living on those blessings like the children i did not understand them and destroy that is try to destroy what i live by and as soon as an important moment of life comes like the children when they are cold and hungry i turn to him and even less than the children when their mother scolds them for their childish mischief do i feel that my childish efforts at wanton madness are reckoned against me yes what i know i know not by reason but it has been given to me revealed to me and i know it with my heart by faith in the chief thing taught by the church the church the church levin repeated to himself he turned over on the other side and leaning on his elbow fell to gazing into the distance at a herd of cattle crossing over to the river but can i believe in all the church teaches he thought trying himself and thinking of everything that could destroy his present peace of mind intentionally he recalled all those doctrines of the church which had always seemed most strange and had always been a stumbling block to him the creation but how did i explain existence by existence by nothing the devil and sin but how do i explain evil the atonement but i know nothing nothing and i can know nothing but what has been told to me and all men and it seemed to him that there was not a single article of faith of the church which could destroy the chief thing faith in god in goodness as the one goal of mans destiny under every article of faith of the church could be put the faith in the service of truth instead of ones desires and each doctrine did not simply leave that faith unshaken each doctrine seemed essential to complete that great miracle continually manifest upon earth that made it possible for each man and millions of different sorts of men wise men and imbeciles old men and children all men peasants lvov kitty beggars and kings to understand perfectly the same one thing and to build up thereby that life of the soul which alone is worth living and which alone is precious to us lying on his back he gazed up now into the high cloudless sky do i not know that that is infinite space and that it is not a round arch but however i screw up my eyes and strain my sight i cannot see it not round and not bounded and in spite of my knowing about infinite space i am incontestably right when i see a solid blue dome and more right than when i strain my eyes to see beyond it levin ceased thinking and only as it were listened to mysterious voices that seemed talking joyfully and earnestly within him can this be faith he thought afraid to believe in his happiness my god i thank thee he said gulping down his sobs and with both hands brushing away the tears that filled his eyes chapter levin looked before him and saw a herd of cattle then he caught sight of his trap with raven in the shafts and the coachman who driving up to the herd said something to the herdsman then he heard the rattle of the wheels and the snort of the sleek horse close by him but he was so buried in his thoughts that he did not even wonder why the coachman had come for him he only thought of that when the coachman had driven quite up to him and shouted to him the mistress sent me your brother has come and some gentleman with him levin got into the trap and took the reins as though just roused out of sleep for a long while levin could not collect his faculties he stared at the sleek horse flecked with lather between his haunches and on his neck where the harness rubbed stared at ivan the coachman sitting beside him and remembered that he was expecting his brother thought that his wife was most likely uneasy at his long absence and tried to guess who was the visitor who had come with his brother and his brother and his wife and the unknown guest seemed to him now quite different from before he fancied that now his relations with all men would be different with my brother there will be none of that aloofness there always used to be between us there will be no disputes with kitty there shall never be quarrels with the visitor whoever he may be i will be friendly and nice with the servants with ivan it will all be different pulling the stiff rein and holding in the good horse that snorted with impatience and seemed begging to be let go levin looked round at ivan sitting beside him not knowing what to do with his unoccupied hand continually pressing down his shirt as it puffed out and he tried to find something to start a conversation about with him he would have said that ivan had pulled the saddle girth up too high but that was like blame and he longed for friendly warm talk nothing else occurred to him your honor must keep to the right and mind that stump said the coachman pulling the rein levin held please do not touch and do not teach me said levin angered by this interference now as always interference made him angry and he felt sorrowfully at once how mistaken had been his supposition that his spiritual condition could immediately change him in contact with reality he was not a quarter of a mile from home when he saw grisha and tanya running to meet him uncle kostya mammas coming and grandfather and sergey ivanovitch and someone else they said clambering up into the trap who is he an awfully terrible person and he does like this with his arms said tanya getting up in the trap and mimicking katavasov old or young asked levin laughing reminded of someone he did not know whom by tanyas performance oh i hope it is not a tiresome person thought levin as soon as he turned at a bend in the road and saw the party coming levin recognized katavasov in a straw hat walking along swinging his arms just as tanya had shown him katavasov was very fond of discussing metaphysics having derived his notions from natural science writers who had never studied metaphysics and in moscow levin had had many arguments with him of late and one of these arguments in which katavasov had obviously considered that he came off victorious was the first thing levin thought of as he recognized him no whatever i do i will not argue and give utterance to my ideas lightly he thought getting out of the trap and greeting his brother and katavasov levin asked about his wife she has taken mitya to kolok a copse near the house she meant to have him out there because it is so hot indoors said dolly levin had always advised his wife not to take the baby to the wood thinking it unsafe and he was not pleased to hear this she rushes about from place to place with him said the prince smiling i advised her to try putting him in the ice cellar she meant to come to the bee house she thought you would be there we are going there said dolly well and what are you doing said sergey ivanovitch falling back from the rest and walking beside him oh nothing special busy as usual with the land answered levin well and what about you come for long we have been expecting you for such a long time only for a fortnight i have a great deal to do in moscow at these words the brothers eyes met and levin in spite of the desire he always had stronger than ever just now to be on affectionate and still more open terms with his brother felt an awkwardness in looking at him he dropped his eyes and did not know what to say casting over the subjects of conversation that would be pleasant to sergey ivanovitch and would keep him off the subject of the servian war and the slavonic question at which he had hinted by the allusion to what he had to do in moscow levin began to talk of sergey ivanovitchs book well have there been reviews of your book he asked sergey ivanovitch smiled at the intentional character of the question no one is interested in that now and i less than anyone he said just look darya alexandrovna we shall have a shower he added pointing with a sunshade at the white rain clouds that showed above the aspen tree tops and these words were enough to re establish again between the brothers that tone hardly hostile but chilly which levin had been so longing to avoid levin went up to katavasov it was jolly of you to make up your mind to come he said to him i have been meaning to a long while now we shall have some discussion we will see to that have you been reading spencer no i have not finished reading him said levin but i do not need him now hows that thats interesting why so i mean that i am fully convinced that the solution of the problems that interest me i shall never find in him and his like now but katavasovs serene and good humored expression suddenly struck him and he felt such tenderness for his own happy mood which he was unmistakably disturbing by this conversation that he remembered his resolution and stopped short but we will talk later on he added if we are going to the bee house it is this way along this little path he said addressing them all going along the narrow path to a little uncut meadow covered on one side with thick clumps of brilliant hearts ease among which stood up here and there tall dark green tufts of hellebore levin settled his guests in the dense cool shade of the young aspens on a bench and some stumps purposely put there for visitors to the bee house who might be afraid of the bees and he went off himself to the hut to get bread cucumbers and fresh honey to regale them with trying to make his movements as deliberate as possible and listening to the bees that buzzed more and more frequently past him he walked along the little path to the hut in the very entry one bee hummed angrily caught in his beard but he carefully extricated it going into the shady outer room he took down from the wall his veil that hung on a peg and putting it on and thrusting his hands into his pockets he went into the fenced in bee garden where there stood in the midst of a closely mown space in regular rows fastened with bast on posts all the hives he knew so well the old stocks each with its own history and along the fences the younger swarms hived that year in front of the openings of the hives it made his eyes giddy to watch the bees and drones whirling round and round about the same spot while among them the working bees flew in and out with spoils or in search of them always in the same direction into the wood to the flowering lime trees and back to the hives his ears were filled with the incessant hum in various notes now the busy hum of the working bee flying quickly off then the blaring of the lazy drone and the excited buzz of the bees on guard protecting their property from the enemy and preparing to sting on the farther side of the fence the old bee keeper was shaving a hoop for a tub and he did not see levin levin stood still in the midst of the beehives and did not call him he was glad of a chance to be alone to recover from the influence of ordinary actual life which had already depressed his happy mood he thought that he had already had time to lose his temper with ivan to show coolness to his brother and to talk flippantly with katavasov can it have been only a momentary mood and will it pass and leave no trace he thought but the same instant going back to his mood he felt with delight that something new and important had happened to him real life had only for a time overcast the spiritual peace he had found but it was still untouched within him just as the bees whirling round him now menacing him and distracting his attention prevented him from enjoying complete physical peace forced him to restrain his movements to avoid them so had the petty cares that had swarmed about him from the moment he got into the trap restricted his spiritual freedom but that lasted only so long as he was among them just as his bodily strength was still unaffected in spite of the bees so too was the spiritual strength that he had just become aware of chapter do you know kostya with whom sergey ivanovitch traveled on his way here said dolly doling out cucumbers and honey to the children with vronsky hes going to servia and not alone hes taking a squadron out with him at his own expense said katavasov thats the right thing for him said levin are volunteers still going out then he added glancing at sergey ivanovitch sergey ivanovitch did not answer he was carefully with a blunt knife getting a live bee covered with sticky honey out of a cup full of white honeycomb i should think so you should have seen what was going on at the station yesterday said katavasov biting with a juicy sound into a cucumber well what is one to make of it for mercys sake do explain to me sergey ivanovitch where are all those volunteers going whom are they fighting with asked the old prince unmistakably taking up a conversation that had sprung up in levins absence with the turks sergey ivanovitch answered smiling serenely as he extricated the bee dark with honey and helplessly kicking and put it with the knife on a stout aspen leaf but who has declared war on the turks ivan ivanovitch ragozov and countess lidia ivanovna assisted by madame stahl no one has declared war but people sympathize with their neighbors sufferings and are eager to help them said sergey ivanovitch but the prince is not speaking of help said levin coming to the assistance of his father in law but of war the prince says that private persons cannot take part in war without the permission of the government kostya mind thats a bee really they will sting us said dolly waving away a wasp but thats not a bee it is a wasp said levin well now well whats your own theory katavasov said to levin with a smile distinctly challenging him to a discussion why have not private persons the right to do so oh my theorys this war is on one side such a beastly cruel and awful thing that no one man not to speak of a christian can individually take upon himself the responsibility of beginning wars that can only be done by a government which is called upon to do this and is driven inevitably into war on the other hand both political science and common sense teach us that in matters of state and especially in the matter of war private citizens must forego their personal individual will sergey ivanovitch and katavasov had their replies ready and both began speaking at the same time but the point is my dear fellow that there may be cases when the government does not carry out the will of the citizens and then the public asserts its will said katavasov but evidently sergey ivanovitch did not approve of this answer his brows contracted at katavasovs words and he said something else you do not put the matter in its true light there is no question here of a declaration of war but simply the expression of a human christian feeling our brothers one with us in religion and in race are being massacred even supposing they were not our brothers nor fellow christians but simply children women old people feeling is aroused and russians go eagerly to help in stopping these atrocities fancy if you were going along the street and saw drunken men beating a woman or a child i imagine you would not stop to inquire whether war had been declared on the men but would throw yourself on them and protect the victim but i should not kill them said levin yes you would kill them i do not know if i saw that i might give way to my impulse of the moment but i cannot say beforehand and such a momentary impulse there is not and there cannot be in the case of the oppression of the slavonic peoples possibly for you there is not but for others there is said sergey ivanovitch frowning with displeasure there are traditions still extant among the people of slavs of the true faith suffering under the yoke of the unclean sons of hagar the people have heard of the sufferings of their brethren and have spoken perhaps so said levin evasively but i do not see it i am one of the people myself and i do not feel it here am i too said the old prince i have been staying abroad and reading the papers and i must own up to the time of the bulgarian atrocities i could not make out why it was all the russians were all of a sudden so fond of their slavonic brethren while i did not feel the slightest affection for them i was very much upset thought i was a monster or that it was the influence of carlsbad on me but since i have been here my minds been set at rest i see that there are people besides me who re only interested in russia and not in their slavonic brethren heres konstantin too personal opinions mean nothing in such a case said sergey ivanovitch it is not a matter of personal opinions when all russia the whole people has expressed its will but excuse me i do not see that the people do not know anything about it if you come to that said the old prince oh papa how can you say that and last sunday in church said dolly listening to the conversation please give me a cloth she said to the old man who was looking at the children with a smile why it is not possible that all but what was it in church on sunday the priest had been told to read that he read it they did not understand a word of it then they were told that there was to be a collection for a pious object in church well they pulled out their halfpence and gave them but what for they could not say the people cannot help knowing the sense of their own destinies is always in the people and at such moments as the present that sense finds utterance said sergey ivanovitch with conviction glancing at the old bee keeper the handsome old man with black grizzled beard and thick silvery hair stood motionless holding a cup of honey looking down from the height of his tall figure with friendly serenity at the gentlefolk obviously understanding nothing of their conversation and not caring to understand it thats so no doubt he said with a significant shake of his head at sergey ivanovitchs words here then ask him he knows nothing about it and thinks nothing said levin have you heard about the war mihalitch he said turning to him what they read in the church what do you think about it ought we to fight for the christians what should we think alexander nikolaevitch our emperor has thought for us he thinks for us indeed in all things it is clearer for him to see shall i bring a bit more bread give the little lad some more he said addressing darya alexandrovna and pointing to grisha who had finished his crust i do not need to ask said sergey ivanovitch we have seen and are seeing hundreds and hundreds of people who give up everything to serve a just cause come from every part of russia and directly and clearly express their thought and aim they bring their halfpence or go themselves and say directly what for what does it mean it means to my thinking said levin who was beginning to get warm that among eighty millions of people there can always be found not hundreds as now but tens of thousands of people who have lost caste never do wells who are always ready to go anywhere to pogatchevs bands to khiva to servia i tell you that it is not a case of hundreds or of never do wells but the best representatives of the people said sergey ivanovitch with as much irritation as if he were defending the last penny of his fortune and what of the subscriptions in this case it is a whole people directly expressing their will that word people is so vague said levin parish clerks teachers and one in a thousand of the peasants maybe know what it is all about the rest of the eighty millions like mihalitch far from expressing their will have not the faintest idea what there is for them to express their will about what right have we to say that this is the peoples will chapter sergey ivanovitch being practiced in argument did not reply but at once turned the conversation to another aspect of the subject oh if you want to learn the spirit of the people by arithmetical computation of course it is very difficult to arrive at it and voting has not been introduced among us and cannot be introduced for it does not express the will of the people but there are other ways of reaching that it is felt in the air it is felt by the heart i will not speak of those deep currents which are astir in the still ocean of the people and which are evident to every unprejudiced man let us look at society in the narrow sense all the most diverse sections of the educated public hostile before are merged in one every division is at an end all the public organs say the same thing over and over again all feel the mighty torrent that has overtaken them and is carrying them in one direction yes all the newspapers do say the same thing said the prince thats true but so it is the same thing that all the frogs croak before a storm one can hear nothing for them frogs or no frogs i am not the editor of a paper and i do not want to defend them but i am speaking of the unanimity in the intellectual world said sergey ivanovitch addressing his brother levin would have answered but the old prince interrupted him well about that unanimity thats another thing one may say said the prince theres my son in law stepan arkadyevitch you know him hes got a place now on the committee of a commission and something or other i do not remember only theres nothing to do in it why dolly it is no secret and a salary of eight thousand you try asking him whether his post is of use he will prove to you that it is most necessary and hes a truthful man too but theres no refusing to believe in the utility of eight thousand roubles yes he asked me to give a message to darya alexandrovna about the post said sergey ivanovitch reluctantly feeling the princes remark to be ill timed so it is with the unanimity of the press thats been explained to me as soon as theres war their incomes are doubled how can they help believing in the destinies of the people and the slavonic races and all that i do not care for many of the papers but thats unjust said sergey ivanovitch i would only make one condition pursued the old prince alphonse karr said a capital thing before the war with prussia you consider war to be inevitable very good let everyone who advocates war be enrolled in a special regiment of advance guards for the front of every storm of every attack to lead them all a nice lot the editors would make said katavasov with a loud roar as he pictured the editors he knew in this picked legion but they had run said dolly they had only be in the way oh if they ran away then we had have grape shot or cossacks with whips behind them said the prince but thats a joke and a poor one too if you will excuse my saying so prince said sergey ivanovitch i do not see that it was a joke that levin was beginning but sergey ivanovitch interrupted him every member of society is called upon to do his own special work said he and men of thought are doing their work when they express public opinion and the single hearted and full expression of public opinion is the service of the press and a phenomenon to rejoice us at the same time twenty years ago we should have been silent but now we have heard the voice of the russian people which is ready to rise as one man and ready to sacrifice itself for its oppressed brethren that is a great step and a proof of strength but it is not only making a sacrifice but killing turks said levin timidly the people make sacrifices and are ready to make sacrifices for their soul but not for murder he added instinctively connecting the conversation with the ideas that had been absorbing his mind for their soul thats a most puzzling expression for a natural science man do you understand what sort of thing is the soul said katavasov smiling oh you know no by god i have not the faintest idea said katavasov with a loud roar of laughter i bring not peace but a sword says christ sergey ivanovitch rejoined for his part quoting as simply as though it were the easiest thing to understand the very passage that had always puzzled levin most thats so no doubt the old man repeated again he was standing near them and responded to a chance glance turned in his direction ah my dear fellow you are defeated utterly defeated cried katavasov good humoredly levin reddened with vexation not at being defeated but at having failed to control himself and being drawn into argument no i cannot argue with them he thought they wear impenetrable armor while i am naked he saw that it was impossible to convince his brother and katavasov and he saw even less possibility of himself agreeing with them what they advocated was the very pride of intellect that had almost been his ruin he could not admit that some dozens of men among them his brother had the right on the ground of what they were told by some hundreds of glib volunteers swarming to the capital to say that they and the newspapers were expressing the will and feeling of the people and a feeling which was expressed in vengeance and murder he could not admit this because he neither saw the expression of such feelings in the people among whom he was living nor found them in himself and he could not but consider himself one of the persons making up the russian people and most of all because he like the people did not know and could not know what is for the general good though he knew beyond a doubt that this general good could be attained only by the strict observance of that law of right and wrong which has been revealed to every man and therefore he could not wish for war or advocate war for any general objects whatever he said as mihalitch did and the people who had expressed their feeling in the traditional invitations of the varyagi be princes and rule over us gladly we promise complete submission all the labor all humiliations all sacrifices we take upon ourselves but we will not judge and decide and now according to sergey ivanovitchs account the people had foregone this privilege they had bought at such a costly price he wanted to say too that if public opinion were an infallible guide then why were not revolutions and the commune as lawful as the movement in favor of the slavonic peoples but these were merely thoughts that could settle nothing one thing could be seen beyond doubt that was that at the actual moment the discussion was irritating sergey ivanovitch and so it was wrong to continue it and levin ceased speaking and then called the attention of his guests to the fact that the storm clouds were gathering and that they had better be going home before it rained chapter the old prince and sergey ivanovitch got into the trap and drove off the rest of the party hastened homewards on foot but the storm clouds turning white and then black moved down so quickly that they had to quicken their pace to get home before the rain the foremost clouds lowering and black as soot laden smoke rushed with extraordinary swiftness over the sky they were still two hundred paces from home and a gust of wind had already blown up and every second the downpour might be looked for the children ran ahead with frightened and gleeful shrieks darya alexandrovna struggling painfully with her skirts that clung round her legs was not walking but running her eyes fixed on the children the men of the party holding their hats on strode with long steps beside her they were just at the steps when a big drop fell splashing on the edge of the iron guttering the children and their elders after them ran into the shelter of the house talking merrily katerina alexandrovna levin asked of agafea mihalovna who met them with kerchiefs and rugs in the hall we thought she was with you she said and mitya in the copse he must be and the nurse with him levin snatched up the rugs and ran towards the copse in that brief interval of time the storm clouds had moved on covering the sun so completely that it was dark as an eclipse stubbornly as though insisting on its rights the wind stopped levin and tearing the leaves and flowers off the lime trees and stripping the white birch branches into strange unseemly nakedness it twisted everything on one side acacias flowers burdocks long grass and tall tree tops the peasant girls working in the garden ran shrieking into shelter in the servants quarters the streaming rain had already flung its white veil over all the distant forest and half the fields close by and was rapidly swooping down upon the copse the wet of the rain spurting up in tiny drops could be smelt in the air holding his head bent down before him and struggling with the wind that strove to tear the wraps away from him levin was moving up to the copse and had just caught sight of something white behind the oak tree when there was a sudden flash the whole earth seemed on fire and the vault of heaven seemed crashing overhead opening his blinded eyes levin gazed through the thick veil of rain that separated him now from the copse and to his horror the first thing he saw was the green crest of the familiar oak tree in the middle of the copse uncannily changing its position can it have been struck levin hardly had time to think when moving more and more rapidly the oak tree vanished behind the other trees and he heard the crash of the great tree falling upon the others the flash of lightning the crash of thunder and the instantaneous chill that ran through him were all merged for levin in one sense of terror my god my god not on them he said and though he thought at once how senseless was his prayer that they should not have been killed by the oak which had fallen now he repeated it knowing that he could do nothing better than utter this senseless prayer running up to the place where they usually went he did not find them there they were at the other end of the copse under an old lime tree they were calling him two figures in dark dresses they had been light summer dresses when they started out were standing bending over something it was kitty with the nurse the rain was already ceasing and it was beginning to get light when levin reached them the nurse was not wet on the lower part of her dress but kitty was drenched through and her soaked clothes clung to her though the rain was over they still stood in the same position in which they had been standing when the storm broke both stood bending over a perambulator with a green umbrella alive unhurt thank god he said splashing with his soaked boots through the standing water and running up to them kittys rosy wet face was turned towards him and she smiled timidly under her shapeless sopped hat are not you ashamed of yourself i cannot think how you can be so reckless he said angrily to his wife it was not my fault really we were just meaning to go when he made such a to do that we had to change him we were just kitty began defending herself mitya was unharmed dry and still fast asleep well thank god i do not know what i am saying they gathered up the babys wet belongings the nurse picked up the baby and carried it levin walked beside his wife and penitent for having been angry he squeezed her hand when the nurse was not looking chapter during the whole of that day in the extremely different conversations in which he took part only as it were with the top layer of his mind in spite of the disappointment of not finding the change he expected in himself levin had been all the while joyfully conscious of the fulness of his heart after the rain it was too wet to go for a walk besides the storm clouds still hung about the horizon and gathered here and there black and thundery on the rim of the sky the whole party spent the rest of the day in the house no more discussions sprang up on the contrary after dinner everyone was in the most amiable frame of mind at first katavasov amused the ladies by his original jokes which always pleased people on their first acquaintance with him then sergey ivanovitch induced him to tell them about the very interesting observations he had made on the habits and characteristics of common houseflies and their life sergey ivanovitch too was in good spirits and at tea his brother drew him on to explain his views of the future of the eastern question and he spoke so simply and so well that everyone listened eagerly kitty was the only one who did not hear it all she was summoned to give mitya his bath a few minutes after kitty had left the room she sent for levin to come to the nursery leaving his tea and regretfully interrupting the interesting conversation and at the same time uneasily wondering why he had been sent for as this only happened on important occasions levin went to the nursery although he had been much interested by sergey ivanovitchs views of the new epoch in history that would be created by the emancipation of forty millions of men of slavonic race acting with russia a conception quite new to him and although he was disturbed by uneasy wonder at being sent for by kitty as soon as he came out of the drawing room and was alone his mind reverted at once to the thoughts of the morning and all the theories of the significance of the slav element in the history of the world seemed to him so trivial compared with what was passing in his own soul that he instantly forgot it all and dropped back into the same frame of mind that he had been in that morning he did not as he had done at other times recall the whole train of thought that he did not need he fell back at once into the feeling which had guided him which was connected with those thoughts and he found that feeling in his soul even stronger and more definite than before he did not as he had had to do with previous attempts to find comforting arguments need to revive a whole chain of thought to find the feeling now on the contrary the feeling of joy and peace was keener than ever and thought could not keep pace with feeling he walked across the terrace and looked at two stars that had come out in the darkening sky and suddenly he remembered yes looking at the sky i thought that the dome that i see is not a deception and then i thought something i shirked facing something he mused but whatever it was there can be no disproving it i have but to think and all will come clear just as he was going into the nursery he remembered what it was he had shirked facing it was that if the chief proof of the divinity was his revelation of what is right how is it this revelation is confined to the christian church alone what relation to this revelation have the beliefs of the buddhists mohammedans who preached and did good too it seemed to him that he had an answer to this question but he had not time to formulate it to himself before he went into the nursery kitty was standing with her sleeves tucked up over the baby in the bath hearing her husbands footstep she turned towards him summoning him to her with her smile with one hand she was supporting the fat baby that lay floating and sprawling on its back while with the other she squeezed the sponge over him come look look she said when her husband came up to her agafea mihalovnas right he knows us mitya had on that day given unmistakable incontestable signs of recognizing all his friends as soon as levin approached the bath the experiment was tried and it was completely successful the cook sent for with this object bent over the baby he frowned and shook his head disapprovingly kitty bent down to him he gave her a beaming smile propped his little hands on the sponge and chirruped making such a queer little contented sound with his lips that kitty and the nurse were not alone in their admiration levin too was surprised and delighted the baby was taken out of the bath drenched with water wrapped in towels dried and after a piercing scream handed to his mother well i am glad you are beginning to love him said kitty to her husband when she had settled herself comfortably in her usual place with the baby at her breast i am so glad it had begun to distress me you said you had no feeling for him no did i say that i only said i was disappointed what disappointed in him not disappointed in him but in my own feeling i had expected more i had expected a rush of new delightful emotion to come as a surprise and then instead of that disgust pity she listened attentively looking at him over the baby while she put back on her slender fingers the rings she had taken off while giving mitya his bath and most of all at there being far more apprehension and pity than pleasure today after that fright during the storm i understand how i love him kittys smile was radiant were you very much frightened she said so was i too but i feel it more now that it is over i am going to look at the oak how nice katavasov is and what a happy day we have had altogether and you are so nice with sergey ivanovitch when you care to be well go back to them it is always so hot and steamy here after the bath chapter going out of the nursery and being again alone levin went back at once to the thought in which there was something not clear instead of going into the drawing room where he heard voices he stopped on the terrace and leaning his elbows on the parapet he gazed up at the sky it was quite dark now and in the south where he was looking there were no clouds the storm had drifted on to the opposite side of the sky and there were flashes of lightning and distant thunder from that quarter levin listened to the monotonous drip from the lime trees in the garden and looked at the triangle of stars he knew so well and the milky way with its branches that ran through its midst at each flash of lightning the milky way and even the bright stars vanished but as soon as the lightning died away they reappeared in their places as though some hand had flung them back with careful aim well what is it perplexes me levin said to himself feeling beforehand that the solution of his difficulties was ready in his soul though he did not know it yet yes the one unmistakable incontestable manifestation of the divinity is the law of right and wrong which has come into the world by revelation and which i feel in myself and in the recognition of which i do not make myself but whether i will or not i am made one with other men in one body of believers which is called the church well but the jews the mohammedans the confucians the buddhists what of them he put to himself the question he had feared to face can these hundreds of millions of men be deprived of that highest blessing without which life has no meaning he pondered a moment but immediately corrected himself but what am i questioning he said to himself i am questioning the relation to divinity of all the different religions of all mankind i am questioning the universal manifestation of god to all the world with all those misty blurs what am i about to me individually to my heart has been revealed a knowledge beyond all doubt and unattainable by reason and here i am obstinately trying to express that knowledge in reason and words do not i know that the stars do not move he asked himself gazing at the bright planet which had shifted its position up to the topmost twig of the birch tree but looking at the movements of the stars i cannot picture to myself the rotation of the earth and i am right in saying that the stars move and could the astronomers have understood and calculated anything if they had taken into account all the complicated and varied motions of the earth all the marvelous conclusions they have reached about the distances weights movements and deflections of the heavenly bodies are only founded on the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies about a stationary earth on that very motion i see before me now which has been so for millions of men during long ages and was and will be always alike and can always be trusted and just as the conclusions of the astronomers would have been vain and uncertain if not founded on observations of the seen heavens in relation to a single meridian and a single horizon so would my conclusions be vain and uncertain if not founded on that conception of right which has been and will be always alike for all men which has been revealed to me as a christian and which can always be trusted in my soul the question of other religions and their relations to divinity i have no right to decide and no possibility of deciding oh you have not gone in then he heard kittys voice all at once as she came by the same way to the drawing room what is it you are not worried about anything she said looking intently at his face in the starlight but she could not have seen his face if a flash of lightning had not hidden the stars and revealed it in that flash she saw his face distinctly and seeing him calm and happy she smiled at him she understands he thought she knows what i am thinking about shall i tell her or not yes i will tell her but at the moment he was about to speak she began speaking kostya do something for me she said go into the corner room and see if they have made it all right for sergey ivanovitch i cannot very well see if they have put the new wash stand in it very well i will go directly said levin standing up and kissing her no i would better not speak of it he thought when she had gone in before him it is a secret for me alone of vital importance for me and not to be put into words this new feeling has not changed me has not made me happy and enlightened all of a sudden as i had dreamed just like the feeling for my child there was no surprise in this either faith or not faith i do not know what it is but this feeling has come just as imperceptibly through suffering and has taken firm root in my soul i shall go on in the same way losing my temper with ivan the coachman falling into angry discussions expressing my opinions tactlessly there will be still the same wall between the holy of holies of my soul and other people even my wife i shall still go on scolding her for my own terror and being remorseful for it i shall still be as unable to understand with my reason why i pray and i shall still go on praying but my life now my whole life apart from anything that can happen to me every minute of it is no more meaningless as it was before but it has the positive meaning of goodness which i have the power to put into it
